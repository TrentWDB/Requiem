Requiem

**Low poly online 3d game in development**

Choose a side, and fight in a world of lost cities, forests of secrets and glittering waterfalls that has become scarce of the spirits that once roamed it, the spirits nearing extinction.

The spirit genocide began when man discovered the ancient secret that a spirit’s abilities could be harvested by slaying it. At first, only the most ‘evil’ of wraiths were killed - the ones who had murdered countless people and destroyed lands. However, over time, the idea of what qualified as evil began to change. The realm split into two nations. One nation believed that all spirits were inherently evil, and humanity's only hope of survival is to destroy them all with the powers that they have taken. The other swears to protect the spirits, serving as their guardians and using the powers that they have acquired for the good of the remaining specters. The two are constantly at war.

Once a spirit has been killed, its power passes on to the bloodline of the living thing that killed it. If the living thing that killed the spirit and all of its blood descendants are killed, the spirit’s power passes on yet again to whatever ended the bloodline.

This massacre for either personal gain, lust for vengeance of the past, or serving to protect the remaining spirits has left the world in a chaotic and volatile state of war. Humanoids and animals alike have gathered powers which descended from the spirits and are constantly battling for what they believe is just.

Only the strongest of spirits remain. Will you choose to protect, or destroy?
